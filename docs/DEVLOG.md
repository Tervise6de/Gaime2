## 2026-07-13 — AI force concentration → military path now competitive

Addressed the open item from 2026-07-12: the military/domination path badly
underperformed the economic one (committed-player win rate ~15% vs ~50%).

Root cause: rival armies fought **piecemeal**. An army with no winnable adjacent
target just sat still, so forces never gathered — scattered 2-unit stacks lost
where one concentrated stack would have won.

Change (`ai.ts`, pure/deterministic): the military turn is now two phases.
1. **Attack** — strongest armies first take their best winnable adjacent target.
2. **Concentrate** — idle armies march *through friendly territory only* (BFS to
   the nearest frontier region) and converge, merging into one stack strong
   enough to break defences a split force can't. The march never blunders into a
   losing fight (own-land pathing), so it's safe.

Self-play probe (24 seeds × 4 committed archetypes) — win rates went from a wide
**12–50%** spread to a tight **21–29%** across all archetypes (Warlord now the
strongest at 29%; fair 3-way baseline ≈ 33% with nation-0 first-mover edge).
Domination now decides ~half of games (was a rare ~1/6). Median length 69–108
turns, still in the 60–150 target. Every strategy is viable and roughly equal.

Test count: 130 green. Build network-free (0 `fetch`). Browser-smoked: a game
runs cleanly with rivals actively conquering, no console errors.

**Next ideas:** composition-aware AI recruiting (bring siege vs forts, counters
vs the enemy's mix); AI defends threatened home regions / retreats losing armies;
combat-odds preview in the UI before the player commits an attack; national
traits (design §6) for more opening variety.

## 2026-07-12 — Balance pass: game length + victory diversity

Self-play probe (symmetric AI skill, 24 seeds, normal) found two problems:
**games ended too fast** (median 48 turns vs the 60–150 target) and **Great
Works dominated** (won 92% of games — everyone raced wonders).

Changes:
- Wonders are now a slower **national project**: cost 60 → 100, `WONDER_GOAL`
  3 → 4, and the AI builds **only one wonder at a time** (no parallel spam).
  → median game length 48 → ~103 turns.
- **Personality-driven endgame**: only economy-minded nations (Builder/Merchant,
  economy ≥ 0.6) chase wonders; aggressive nations spend on military and seek
  domination. → victory mix broadened from 92% great-works to a spread of
  great-works / domination / prestige; median ~120 turns.
- **Domination threshold 60% → 50%** so conquest is a more reachable win.

Committed-player viability (24 seeds each): Builder/Merchant ~50% wins,
Warlord/Opportunist ~12–17%. Length healthy (median ~116) across all.

Test count: 130 green. Build network-free (0 `fetch`).

**Known imbalance for a future cycle:** the **military/domination path still
underperforms the economic path** (~15% vs ~50% win rate for a committed
player). Next: give aggression more teeth — cheaper/stronger military via
tech, better AI force-concentration and siege use, or a small conquest economic
reward — then re-probe until the paths are within ~15–20 points of each other.

## Baseline — v1 complete (Milestones 1–6)

The full game loop is shipped and playable end-to-end:

- **M1** seeded procedural region-graph map, terrain economy, taxes, treasury,
  pure deterministic turn pipeline.
- **M2** population growth/famine, unrest (the anti-snowball brake), buildings.
- **M3** five-unit counter loop, armies + movement, abstract combat, strategic
  resources, upkeep/bankruptcy, conquest, barbarian regions.
- **M4** 1–3 rule-based AI rivals with personality archetypes; relations +
  diplomacy (war/peace/pact/alliance/gift/tribute). 100% local AI.
- **M5** 16-tech branching tree, three victory paths (domination / Great Works /
  prestige score), bounded random events.
- **M6** difficulty settings, save/load (autosave + manual checkpoint), keyboard
  end-turn, victory/defeat screen, balance pass, network-free build.

**State:** 130 unit tests green; `typecheck`, `test`, `build` all pass; built
bundle makes zero network calls; `dependencies: {}`.

**Good next tasks:** balance self-play probes (target 60–150 turn games, fair
win distribution); AI army defence/retreat logic; national traits; combat-odds
preview; tech-tree screen; Voronoi renderer.
