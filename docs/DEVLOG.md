# Gaime2 — development log

Newest entries at the top. Each autonomous overnight cycle appends one entry:
what changed and why, the test count after, and ideas for next time. See
`docs/autonomous-dev-prompt.md` for the playbook these runs follow.

## Baseline — v1 complete (Milestones 1–6)

The full game loop is shipped and playable end-to-end:

- **M1** seeded procedural region-graph map, terrain economy, taxes, treasury,
  pure deterministic turn pipeline.
- **M2** population growth/famine, unrest (the anti-snowball brake), buildings.
- **M3** five-unit counter loop, armies + movement, abstract combat, strategic
  resources, upkeep/bankruptcy, conquest, barbarian regions.
- **M4** 1–3 rule-based AI rivals with personality archetypes; relations +
  diplomacy (war/peace/pact/alliance/gift/tribute). 100% local AI.
- **M5** 16-tech branching tree, three victory paths (domination / Great Works /
  prestige score), bounded random events.
- **M6** difficulty settings, save/load (autosave + manual checkpoint), keyboard
  end-turn, victory/defeat screen, balance pass, network-free build.

**State:** 130 unit tests green; `typecheck`, `test`, `build` all pass; built
bundle makes zero network calls; `dependencies: {}`.

**Good next tasks:** balance self-play probes (target 60–150 turn games, fair
win distribution); AI army defence/retreat logic; national traits; combat-odds
preview; tech-tree screen; Voronoi renderer.
